<h3>Consume - 2017 -</h3>

This art linked a JavaScript Snake clone that I reskinned for a 3rd year art project. It was hosted online for a year and was available free to play on any device or browser via scanning a QR code posters and stickers that linked to the website, The gallery display had a framed and decorated 7 inch screen running off a Raspberry Pi in a web browser with arcade buttons to move the player controlled via a Python scripts.
