When first getting a website up and running I had originally built up a wordpress site and hosted it with a hosting company under one of their free accounts.
Due to some restrictions with the domain name and being unable to get https without paying I've since moved to github-pages and started things fresh
in an effort to build and maintain a minimal cost website.
A migration from x10hosting to github is finally functional!
