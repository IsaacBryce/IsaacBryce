It's a slow process learning how github pages works and coming from a wordpress setup has its quirks in its own right. I am slowly getting back into the swing of development after a 2 months focused on other things. I had some issues with the css not loading due to the way jekyll reads things before and after the domain name came online... all fixed for now though.
