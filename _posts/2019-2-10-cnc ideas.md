I've made some neat stuff with a 2 watt laser kit off the web but The working space was tiny though so...
Im Looking to build some sort of cnc router/laser cutter of sorts.
I imagine some adaptation of the MPCNC and Low Rider builds...
I think adding a 15w laser to the router would add a Bunch of functionality.
I like the idea of using the dewalt router and as its in the garage, noise isn't so much of an issue.
Id like half sheets of ply to fit in the bed for practicality, the ability to feed longer/taller wood through is also a preference.
not really looking to use it on alloy .... but if the cut rate is low enough....

will come back to this crazyness
