Spare Time Development is an art and design studio based out of the far north of New Zealand. Designed to display online artistic musings ranging across platforms and media. Using free and open source software for creation whenever possible.

Started by creator Isaac Bryce after finishing his BAA with a Digital endorsement at Northtec Whangarei in 2017 . Utilising a variety of software we create and develop illustrations, 2D and 3D animations, 3D modeling and printing as well as video game/web Development.
