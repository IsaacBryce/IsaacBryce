Spare Time Development is an Art and Design Studio based out of the far north of New Zealand. This website is designed to display online artistic musings ranging across platforms and media. Created using free and open source software for creation whenever possible.

Started by creator Isaac Bryce while finishing his BAA with a Digital endorsement from Northtec Whangarei in 2017. Utilising a variety of software we create and develop illustrations, 2D and 3D Characters and Animations, 3D modeling and printing as well as Game/Web Development.

For a closer look at some of Isaac's artworks check out his [artstation page][as] at [https://www.artstation.com/sparetimedev][as]
