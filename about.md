Spare Time Development is an art and design studio based out of the far north of New Zealand. Designed to display online artistic musings ranging across platforms and media.

Started by creator Isaac Bryce after finishing his BAA with a Digital endorsement at Northtec Whangarei in 2017 . Utilising a variety of software we create and develop illustrations, animations and video games from initial ideas using open source software for creation whenever possible.

For a closer look at some of Isaac's artworks check out his [artstation page][as] at [https://www.artstation.com/sparetimedev][as]
