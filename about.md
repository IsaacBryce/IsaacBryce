Spare Time Development is an Art and Design Studio based out of Tautoro in the far north of New Zealand. This website is designed to display artistic musings ranging across platforms and media. Created using free and open source software for creation when possible.

Started by creator Isaac Bryce while finishing his BAA with a Digital endorsement from NorthTec Whangarei in 2017. Isaac uses a variety of software and computer languages to create an array of digital and analog art, From sketching out character assets to compiling games for browser or mobile devices using current game engines. 

Isaac has image and video editing experience using some of the adobe suit, such as Photoshop and Premier throughout his studies but often opted for open-source replacements Blender and Krita where possible. 
He also has development experience with websites and game development with C# using Unity as well as some automation projects with Arduino and Python 3. 

during 2019 Isaac took part in the first official New Zealand medicinal cannabis course run by AUT so publicly available art has slowed to a trickle.
