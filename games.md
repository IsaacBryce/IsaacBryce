[Get Home][gh] 2016 - Take Control of a drunk Buisness man on the way home from work, In the game, you needs to keep the character balanced because our character is drunk. Basically the whole game has only one task; this is to help the character get home safely.
This was my first dip into Game Development with Unity, It was a 3 person student project with myself heading the programming and animation and the other two heading up marketing and character/story design. It was left unfinished but a semi working demo was produced.

Consume 2017 (WEBSITE DOWN) - This was a JavaScript "Snake clone" that I reskinned for a 3rd year art project. It was hosted online for a year and was available free to play on any device or browser via scanning a QR code that linked to the website, The gallery display had a framed 7 inch screen running off a Raspberry Pi with arcade buttons to move the player via a Python script.      


[Tap n Smash][tns] 2018 - Its a break out clone and my first solo unity project and following a 2d Unity tutorial in aims to further my c# . this was mostly rushed through as a learning experience and should probably be re-polished.
