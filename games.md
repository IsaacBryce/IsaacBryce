These are some of the gaming projects I've participated in along the journey of teaching myself to code, using C# and Unity for the most part but I also have some experience with web development (HTML,Js,Css,Python) and mess around with Arduino's on occasion too.  
  
There are multiple other titles in progress as well as other projects going on in general so if you want to keep up to date with something follow me on social media somewhere.

[Get Home][gh] 2016 - Take Control of a drunk Buisness man on the way home from work, In the game, you needs to keep the character balanced because our character is drunk. Basically the whole game has only one task; this is to help the character get home safely.
This was my first dip into Game Development with Unity, It was a 3 person student project with myself heading the programming and animation and the other two heading up marketing and character/story design. It was left unfinished but a semi working demo was produced.
